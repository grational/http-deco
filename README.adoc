## **Introduction**

`http-decò` is a library designed to make executing HTTP requests in JDK languages as easy as possible. It provides a concise and intuitive API for basic HTTP methods and advanced features such as automatic retries, request caching, and AWS authentication.

**Features**

## **Basic HTTP methods:**

```
* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE
* HEAD
```

## **Facilitating HTTP methods:**

```asciidoc
* POST with JSON payload
* PUT with JSON payload
* POST of type x-www-form-urlencoded
```

## **Decorators:**

```asciidoc
* Automatic retry in case of failure
* Automatic request caching with file storage or Redis
* Multi-host redirection
* AWS v4 authentication signing
```

## **Additional features:**

```asciidoc
* Support for basic authentication directly from URL userinfo
* Native support for http_proxy, https_proxy, no_proxy environment variables
* Easy disabling of HTTPS checks for testing with self-signed certificates
* Easy disabling of exceptions for failed requests
* Straightforward support for adding headers to requests
* Straightforward support for adding cookies to requests
```

## **Installation**

The http-decò library is available through jitpack. 

To start using it into your project, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
	// ...
	'com.github.grational:http-deco:4.4.1',
	'org.apache.groovy:groovy:3.0.21',
	// ...
}
```

Or for your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.github.grational</groupId>
	<artifactId>http-deco</artifactId>
	<version>4.4.1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.apache.groovy</groupId>
	<artifactId>groovy</artifactId>
	<version>3.0.21</version>
</dependency>
```

## **Usage example**

```groovy
import it.grational.http.request.*
import it.grational.cache.*
import java.time.Duration

// Example of a GET request
def response = new Get("https://www.google.com").connect()

// Example of a POST request with JSON payload
def json = [name: "John Doe", age: 30]
response = new JsonPost (
	url: "https://api.example.com/users",
	map: [
		name: 'John Doe',
		age: 30
	]
).connect()

// Usage example with automatic retry (3)
def response = new Retry (
   new Get("https://www.polito.it")
)

// Usage example with file caching limited to 5 minutes
def response = new Cache (
	new Get("https://www.polito.it"),
	new CacheFile(),
	Duration.ofMinutes(5)
)
```
