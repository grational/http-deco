## **Installation**

The http-decò library is available through jitpack. To install it, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

<dependency>
 <groupId>com.github.grational</groupId>
 <artifactId>http-deco</artifactId>
 <version>5.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## **Usage example**

```groovy
import it.grational.http.request.*

// Example of GET request
def response = new Get("https://www.google.com").connect()

// Example of POST request with JSON payload
def json = [name: "John Doe", age: 30]
response = new JsonPost (
   url: "https://api.example.com/users",
   map: [
      name: 'John Doe',
      age: 30
   ]
).connect()

// Example of using a decorator for automatic retry
def response = new Retry (
   new Get("https://www.polito.it")
)

// Example of using a decorator for caching
def response = new Cache (
   new Get("https://www.polito.it")
)
```
